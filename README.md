# Parallelization-Of-Poison-Equation-In-2d-Space-Using-Jacobi-Iteration
This is the project made for Operating System Course. Here we have a C++ implementation of Parallelization Of Poison Equation In 2d Space Using Jacobi Iteration. Its execution timing is also compared with Serial implementaion Of Poison Equation In 2d Space Using Jacobi Iteration.
